- Now Login With Your Email Id, Enter OTP and back to ur Terminal/Wsl? **( VPS users check FAQ1 )**




- Now U can see A `ORG_ID` On ur Terminal..Save it!


* Now It will promt `Would you like to push models you train in the RL swarm to the Hugging Face Hub? [y/N]` Enter `N`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### üî¥ Daemon failed to start in 15.0 seconds
- If you are facing this issue then follow this step by step guide
- First use tihs command
```
nano $(python3 -c "import hivemind.p2p.p2p_daemon as m; print(m.__file__)")
```
- Then scroll down and look for this line `startup_timeout: float = 15,` , here u need to modify this 15 with 120, and after modifying it will look like this : `startup_timeout: float = 120,`
- Save this changes, first use `Ctrl` + `X` and then press `Y` and then press `Enter`
- Now use this command again to run `rl-swarm`
```bash
./run_rl_swarm.sh
```



###  Check Rewards
- Visit : https://gensyn-node.vercel.app/
- Enter Peer-ID that you often see this in your logs


> [!Note]
> If you see `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` in `Connected EOA Address` section, that means your contribution is not being recorded, so you should run the node from beginning with fresh new email (means u need to delete existing `swarm.pem` file
